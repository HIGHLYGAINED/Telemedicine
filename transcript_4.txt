00:05:00 okay Lucas I want you go to the right side and you're going to very slowly note to John's activity John's right side okay so Lucas if you could position your finger like this and slowly move it towards John's knows but get closer to him John tell me when you start to see Lucas his finger moving 
00:05:30 okay great now it looks as if you go to the other side and I asked you to close your left eye this time okay same thing looks is going to move us take it to me when you start to see his finger moving excellent okay Lucas could you very likely tickle John's Jake's like this John doesn't feel the same or different when Lucas does that what's the difference 
00:06:00 okay can you smile show me your teeth excellent okay can you turn your head all the way to the right Debbie Payne when you do that any pain in your neck and can you turn your head all the way to the left and you pay when you do that okay are you bend your head and touch your chin to your chest if you have any discomfort when you do that okay good now can you hold your arms in front of you with your hand soap 
00:06:30 like this and I want you to close your eyes and keep your hands very still okay open your eyes now can you do this and can you do this okay can you roll your arms like this all right very good leg hold it up for 5 seconds 
00:07:00 2 3 4 5 good okay let's try that with the right leg now 1 2 3 4 5 John did you feel like your right leg was as strong as your left now okay Lucas now. Very lightly touch the tops of your hands tell me if they feel the same or different different what's the difference 
00:07:30 I didn't do it, right okay and Lucas could you do the same thing on John's legs left on the right okay I'm can you take your right index finger John and touch the tip of your nose and now it's Lucas holds his finger in front of you can you touch Lucas's finger I'm back to your nose again and back to Lucas his finger how can you do that with the left hand or such you know 
00:08:00 send touch his finger excellent now can you take your left heel and put it on your right knee and slowly slide it down your shin in a straight line and then back up again excellent. Can you do the same thing with your right heel on your left knee spot it straight down okay a little more difficult all right 
00:08:30 John I wonder if you could slowly slide your legs over to the edge of the bed and see if you can stand and take a few steps if you feel unsteady Lucas is going to be there to support you so wait till he gets there okay before you stand up you feel dizzy or lightheaded 
00:09:00 regresa be there in case he needs you and can you hold your arms in front of you and close your eyes okay good open your eyes to see if you can take a couple of steps okay and turn around and come back all right 
00:09:30 okay let's have you come back into the bed did you feel like you're walking was not normal John I think I'm the right do we have any recent Vital Signs Lucas 41708 / 85 heart rate of 92 you breathing about 18 times a minute and setting 93% on room air 
00:10:00 and we have approximate weight how much do I John have you ever had any a bleeding problems now have you had any operations in the last several months I have not have you had any accidents or head injuries have you ever had an occasion to take a blood thinner now 
00:10:30 okay I'm so John I had the opportunity before I spoke with you to look at the CT scan that you had and it is normal despite that I have a concern that the weakness and numbness that you are reporting on the right side of your body could be due to a stroke now I think it's fortunate that you got him to the hospital quickly within an hour of the symptoms beginning because I'm such a situation 
00:11:00 gender are some emergency interventions that we can offer you to help you recover from stroke spoken to the emergency room doctor about that one of the things that we are able to do is give you a medication which is called TPA have you ever heard of that medication is a medication that is used to dissolve blood clots and a stroke often occurs because a blood clot lodges in a blood vessel in the brain and cause 
00:11:30 neurological symptoms so by giving you this medication we are able to improve your recovery from stroke especially for able to give it within the first several hours after the symptoms begin a people that receive TPA have about a 30% better recovery from stroke than those who did not receive it however there is also an Associated risk of bleeding in the bleeding can occur anywhere on the body it can be mild or insignificant and rarely can also be life threatening 
00:12:00 are the incidence of bleeding overall is approximately 1 to 3% means out of a hundred people 1 2 3 may have a bleeding problem because of your otherwise General good health I would estimate the Yaris would be in the lower end of the range so because you've come to us within an hour of your symptoms and because we don't see anything abnormal on the CT scan yet and it seems to me that you may have suffered a small stroke I am recommending that we give you 
00:12:30 medication to help you recover from the weakness that you develop I know that's a lot of information to digest all at once did you have any particular questions about anything that I've explained to you will I get better well we hope that you get better and you could also get better without the medication I receiving TPA your chances of recovery 
00:13:00 then what happens after so the medication is given in the IV and takes about an hour to receive the medication and as a matter of routine everybody who receives TPA is watched closely in an ICU for 24 hours and we monitor you for blood pressure changes in any signs of bleeding after that we will repeat your CT scan make sure that there has been no bleeding and then we will try to do some tests 
00:13:30 to figure out why you had the stroke and some of those tests might include looking at your heart with ultrasound to see if there any blood clots there that could have dislodged to cause a stroke or want to take a look at the arteries in your neck and will also do some blood tests to see what your cholesterol is in your blood sugar and other things like that unless you want to monitor your heartbeat irregularity is there a certain irregular heartbeats that can be disposed people to have strokes 
00:14:00 I'd like to find that out as well on the test I'm going to recommend and if you allow us to proceed with CPA to do another CT scan with contrast CT angiogram this will enable us to look at the blood vessels in your in your neck as well as in your brain if you do see a blood clot in a large blood vessel you may have your candidates for other treatments as well including a procedure where we can actually go in and 
00:14:30 Clyde Alex buy a catheter placed in the blood vessel itself that would depend again if we find such a large blood vessel occlusion so just to summarize I think that you had a small stroke that you got in here within an hour and I don't see any contraindications to receiving TPA which is a medication that can improve your outcome from stroke but it does have a small risk of bleeding 
00:15:00 would you like us to proceed with wtpa at this time OK Google do we have any of John Fleming a blood test back for example to have annoying are is platelet count is 2:35 okay are there any abnormal labs no. We have a b o n in the creatinine do not have it be okay 
00:15:30 it would be good to have that before we do the CTA just because we don't want to endanger his kidneys by giving him die if his creatinine is not normal okay excellent okay did you have any other questions thank you okay excellent EPA at bedside if you Kiddin Around through the testing of the medication okay 
00:16:00 set volume to figure out your dosages based on weight so if you weigh a hundred 75 lb that's approximately 79.5 kilos that would correspond to a TPA dose of 71.6 milligrams in total we will give a 
00:16:30 list of 10% of that which would be 7.2 mg and the remaining Dallas will be infused IV over 1 hour so we can start with the 7.2 mg bolus can you read me what it says on the bottle says 158 million international units correct that is the correct medication 
00:17:00 TPA and we can proceed to mix set up and prepare a 7.2 milligram bolus and give you the remaining that was over an hour to get back to me immediately if you'd like I can stand camera while you give the Bellas kiss have any questions come up 
00:17:30 boss has given okay so we're going to record that at 9:52 eastern time and it certainly gotten off to a good start thank you
