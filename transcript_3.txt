00:10:30 the last one 
00:11:00 okay close your eyes man nurse can you touch her hair okay great thanks 
00:11:30 are CT scan really quickly I don't know if they told you but the concern isn't that you may be having a stroke because lack of oxygen to the brain and I'm sorry that went to go so quickly and whenever you having a stroke 
00:12:00 should have just bleeding strokes and have a good non bleeding stroke CT scan shows no bleeding so that's God but we are concerned that you're having a stroke we do have medication for that medication is called CPA at the clot-busting medicine that you're having right now getting worse and make them get better 
00:12:30 in addition to the rest the rest of the Bible study that we did almost 30 years ago and asked me to ask you a couple questions really quickly 
00:13:00 and no bleeding in your head ever a trauma recently and pleading inside and I didn't let the dogs out by The Offspring side okay great and that's pretty. Right right so that's pretty much at the Madison like I said it's time sensitive and I know it's overwhelming but we have to make a decision is there something that you think 
00:13:30 the process that ensures that the medicines given the nurse will ejected and you over a minute and then will Infuse you up to a pump and IV for about an hour while you're getting the Madison will take you for another CT scan of specialized stand to look at the arteries and side of your brain the purpose of that we may have to call 
00:14:00 bladder specialist evaluate you to try and retrieve the clot by going through the artery in the groin and removing it and then depending on whether or not there's a large clot there or not if there's the reason why I asked you to go there just because the nurses are able to monitor you more 
00:14:30 I'm just like we did in your vitals making sure that everything's okay and then you'll be getting a number path to figure out why this happened to you sometime stroke is related to the heart 
00:15:00 pumping correctly and then you can get an irregular heartbeat that causes a clot to form their sometimes it's related to the arteries and you do have diabetes that may be related to that lots of different causes and General Hospital stay home and I'm evaluate whether or not you need to have for the rehabilitation 
00:15:30 you take the medicine something you'd be interested in I know it's kind of overwhelming recipe to get to Ivy then I'm going to call the ER doctor man cuz we already here and so just to make sure that they feel comfortable with the plan as well and then if they do with the medication 
00:16:00 dessert place in public doctor a bolus of 7.2 with a total dose of 71.5 and a discarded 28.5 
00:16:30 64.3 * 28.5 and 50 cc's in normal saline and do we have another blood pressure 
00:17:00 5 / 78 okay. So Molly High just keep an eye on that horse still under call let me know when you're ready to give the medicine 
00:17:30 23 but what time is it there all right so I we just stay there while they're giving that initial bolus man's if you do and then we'll go ahead and take you for that specialized CT scan any questions for me 
00:18:00 yeah I understand the team there they'll also reiterate everything that I mentioned on the nurse will go over with you again the plan that I discuss and all right thanks
